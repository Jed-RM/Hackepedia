				<h2> Malware </h2>
		
				<p><b>Malware <i>(Malicious Software)</i></b> is an umbrella term of cybercrime that involves a 
				software or code intended <b>to harm an infected gadget.</b> Malware developers use malware for 
				stealing user information, damaging the infected hardware, accessing the victimâ€™s computer, 
				obtaining financial gain, getting entertainment, and many more. There are various types of malware: 
				the <b>virus, worm, spyware, ransomware, trojan horse, adware,</b> and<b> botnet.</b></p>

			<h3>Various types of Malware</h3>
			<ul> 
				<li>A <b>virus</b> is a type of malware that is injected to an unaffected gadget by attaching to a file or 
				e-mail. It is one of the more common malware around the internet.</li>
				<li>A <b>worm</b>, unlike the virus, is programmed to transmit itself from one computer to another. An example of this is
				the <b>infamous "ILOVEYOU" worm</b>, which was spread through e-mail.</li>
				<li>A <b>spyware</b> is a silent malware designed to monitor the affected user, which could lead security
				information being recorded.</li>
				<li>A <b>ransomware</b> is type of malware that hijacks and encrypts the user's computer files for ransom. It prompts the 
				user to send money to the developer in exchanges for the encrypted files. One famous example of ransomware is the <b>2017
				WANNACRY malware</b> which affected <b>more than 200,000 people</b> in various workplaces.</li>
				<li>A <b>trojan horse</b> is a common malware that introduces itself as a harmless treat to unsuspecting victims. As
				the victim proceeds to open the file attached with the malware, it resumes to collect and exploit data, spy the user's
				behavior, or execute damages to the hardware.</li>
				<li>An <b>adware</b> is a type of malware that forces advertisements in display. It can exploit these pop-up advertisements to
				ruin one's computer, collect information, etc.
				<li>A <b>botnet</b> is a type of malware that is known to perform <b>Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDOS) attacks.</b> They are
				network-connected computers that are exploited to collect data, obtain access to one's computer, etc.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Prevention</h3>
			
			<p id=two> There are multiple ways to prevent malwares into infecting your computer, but one key of prevention is
			<b>awareness.</b> Knowing the presence of suspicious links and e-mails, and applying strict security are important.
			Here are some ways to eliminate the chances of being affected by a malware:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Installing an official anti-virus program (<b>BEWARE OF FAKE ANTI-VIRUS PROGRAMS!</b>, as they could also be a subject of malware)</li>
				
				<ul>
					<li><i>Since majority of trusted third-party anti-virus programs are premium, Windows offer Windows Security (also known as Windows Defender) for Windows users.
					XProtect is Mac's counterpart of Windows Security.</i></li>
				</ul>
				
				<li>Avoiding suspicious links and e-mails (Refer to this <a href="htdocs/article_2">article</a>).</li>
				
				<li>Avoiding pirated content/programs</li>
				<li>Doing frequent virus scans (usually provided within anti-virus programs)</li>
				
				<ul>
					<li><i>You can also perform scans on files online with <a href=https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload>VirusTotal</a> which contains
					algorithms from multiple anti-virus programs.</i></li>
				</ul>
				
				<li>Being careful with connecting to public internet modems.</li>
				<li>Reading comments/reviews and description of an application (Not a guarantee way to identify a malware, but provides a good idea of the product)</li>
			</ul>
			</div>
			
			<h3>Trivia</h3>
			
			<ul id=triviaSection>
				<li>Some malwares are limited to one operating system. Although this is true, other malwares begun to become cross-platform.</li>
			</ul>
